# FloatChat-AI

FloatChat-AI is a Python-based project focused on providing intelligent chat experiences powered by AI. This repository is organized for experimentation, development, and deployment of conversational AI features.

## Features

- AI-driven chat logic and conversation management.
- 100% Python codebase for easy modification and extension.
- Modular structure for adding new models or chat features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Recommended: Virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beingbrijesh/FloatChat-AI.git
   cd FloatChat-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If there is a `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If there is no requirements file, manually install needed libraries as referenced in the code.

### Running the Project

Check for the main entrypoint, which is typically named `main.py` or similar. Run it using Python:
```bash
python main.py
```
If the project uses a different entry script, check the repository files for the correct filename and replace `main.py` with the appropriate name.

#### Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To avoid dependency conflicts:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run:
```bash
python main.py
```
